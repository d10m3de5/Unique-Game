# Description:
## This is a very unique, but simple game where the player gets to interact with buttons, trying to find a way to kill ME. The point of this project is to make a game that has not been done before, so our Team: "The Kill3rs", decided to make a game where the main point is to die, in this case Kill ME. There is very unique ways to get ME to die, but the main idea is to think outside of the box. This game has been created with JavaFX, and it includes some Java Programming features such as file saving, user input, and if statements. 

# Main Menu


## Our menu includes basic options such as "Play, How To Play, Quit/Exit, and Credits". These are buttons controls that allows the user to enter the different options once they click on the desired button. Level 2 was created in another separate file, by Andrew T. 
## Please note that this is a PG-13 game, where the player will be asked to enter name and age. If the age is below 13, then he/she cannot play the game. Otherwise, you will be able to enjoy this nice and amazing game.

# Scoring
## Player will automatically sign in with a bonus of 200 points. Some levels will have scoring where the player will get up to 50 points if they advance to next level. However, be aware that if you choose the wrong option, depending the level, a total of 10 points will be deducted. These will then be saved in a file to output your progress or score, name and age, as the user inputs. 

# File Saving
## At the beginning of the game the user will be asked for name and age, and also will be given the points as listed above. These will be saved in a file, named by the user, where the user can then look at their progress in the game. 

# Final Conclusion:
## Just have fun and don't get irritated please. Don't give up! We know you can kill ME. Or at least DIE trying.
